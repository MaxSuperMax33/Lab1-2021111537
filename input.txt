Children laughed as they played tag, repeating the game's cycle of chase and escape.  At noon, the lunch bell rang, echoing the same chime it had for decades.  People sat in the park, enjoying their sandwiches, each bite a repetition of yesterday's lunch.  The park's fountain, with its repetitive splashes, provided a soothing background melody.
